                     The CO2 emissions in the United States are projected to make the Southwest United States much drier over time. New visualizations project that the average temperature across the United States could be 8 degrees Farenheit warmer by the end of the century in the scenario that CO2 emissions have rose to 800 parts per million (they are currently at 400 parts per million but are rising rapidly). This could affect people and force them to migrate in the search of land for growing crops or to find enough water.

                    In a similar way that the Southwestern United States is projected to have drier land, the inverse effect will occur in the Northeastern United States, thus creating wetter land. The CO2 emissions in the United States are projected to make the Northwest United States much wetter over time. However, new visualizations project that the average temperature across the United States could be 8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer by the end of the century in the scenario that CO2 emissions have rose to 800 parts per million (they are currently at 400 parts per million but are rising rapidly). Massachusetts will be effected largely due to frequent storms and future climate change.

                    The combination of people flocking to the coasts and islands in Florida and the rising sea levels due to climate change creates a very dangerous and serious issue. According to this website, global warming has already doubled or possibly even tripled the odds of extreme high water events over widespread areas of the United States coast. Widespread areas that are likely to see storm surges on top of sea level rise reaching at least 4 feet above high tide by 2030, and 5 feet by 2050, and nearly 5 million United States residents currently live on land less than 4 feet above high tide, and more than 6 million on land less than 5 feet above.

                    There are currently tens of thousands of deaths of humans and animals that are existant in Northeastern Africa due to starvation with cause of not being able to farm. This is greatly affecting Somalia, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. It is estimated that half the Somali population, 3.2 million people, are afflicated by starvation and approximately 1,500 Somalis are escaping to Kenya's Dadaab refugee camp daily. Due to the drought, the price of food has increased by 60 percent.

                    Sweden, particularly Southern Sweden, is coping with major flash floods. Many people have already been forced to evacuate their homes, have lost electricity, or have struggled with other environmental issues. It was reported that a campsite in Sweden was closed after forty homes were flooded. Emergency teams even needed to rescue a man who was stuck in his car that was encompassed by water that was one meter deep.

                    After a recent severe tropical storm or typhoon in the Philippines, fifty-four people were reported dead, forty people injured, seven people missing, and 260,000 people were affected. This truculent and deadly storm killed, injured, and evacuated thousands of people by causing landslides and flooding. This typhoon is only one example of the climate issues that the Philippines must cope with. Many people are migrating away from the Philippines due to the issues as well.
