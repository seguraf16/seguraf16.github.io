              India is an ancient country. Though colonized by the British, India has been inhabited continuously since 

almost the beginning of civilization. So why are so many people leaving the country of their ancestors? The 

reasons are multifarious, including extreme poverty, overcrowding, and a lack of jobs. India is a hugely 

populated country, with 15% of the world's population that is predicted to soon be a full fifth (2). The people 

don't have much space either, despite the second largest population in the world, India only possess a 

measly 2.4 percent of the world's landmass. (4) This leads to an incredible amount of overcrowding, and it is 

only getting worse. It is said that the population is itself unsustainable, for the population increases by 29 

people per minute! (4) This in turn leads to an all pervasive lack of jobs, there are so many people needing 

work that the jobs produced in-country simply are not sufficent, forcing Indians to go elsewhere for work. 

There are a full twice as many college graduates as there are jobs requiring college graduates in India. (1) The 

economy in the country is not very strong either, even for those with jobs. With a GDP of a mere $1.875 

trillion, the per capita income of India is $1,497! (5) That is less than one and a half thousand dollars per 

person per year! When overcrowding on India's level and a poor economy are combined, the result is extreme 

poverty, as evinced by the per capita income. Kids are pulled out of school to work or beg, some parents 

even maiming their children to make them into more effective beggars. 25% of Indians live below the poverty 

line, and there are claims that 60% of the world's poor reside in India. (3) With no jobs to be had and extreme 

poverty rampant, many Indians emigrate from their country to find work.

              <strong>UAE</strong>
            </h3>
            
            <p>
              The United Arab Emmigrants (UAE) has a flourishing economy. With a per capita at around 

$30,000(1) and a GDP estimated around $272 billion(1) it is clear to see how the UAE can attract 

potential emmigrants. The UAE attracts so many emmigrants with it's oil rich economy that they 

make up the majority and Indians even make up to 42%(2) of the total population. UAE can only 

keep up this kind of economy because of these emmigrants and is in fact based on these incoming 

people. There are many laws that try to ease the stress of emmigrants as well as having a plethora of 

jobs available. Keeping jobs open and having an expanding economy is essiental for both the 

emmigrants and the UAE. Without new jobs, the emmigrants would still be in poverty and the UAE's 

economy would crash without all the new people coming in.

            Other than the United Arab Emirates, Indians that depart from their home country travel(2) 

primarily to the United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, and Australia. All of these destinations, 

like the migration to the UAE, are based on(3) the large discrepancy between employment in India 

versus the employment in these countries and the large difference in the GDP's(6) of these countries 

compared to India.

 In the United States(5), Indians account for 5% of the foreign-born population and are the 3rd 

largest immigration group (Behind Mexico and China). And, in 2011, 1.9 million Indians lived in the 

United States(1).

 Indians are the 2nd largest immigrating group in Canada(4), with about 25,000-30,000 migrating 

each year. Here, Indian men and women work both white-collar and blue-collar jobs.

 Indians have a history of working on banana plantations during the time when Australia(7) was a 

British colony. Even today, Indians inhabit a large part of Australia, in which they acquire a large sum 

of money by working their banana plantations. Indians are currently the fourth largest immigration 

group in Australia.
