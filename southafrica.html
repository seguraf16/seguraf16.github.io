              There have been many cases of xenophobia in South Africa, in the past and present. With South Africa's high unemployment most South Africans are outraged and are looking for something to blame, many are seeking political change while others are pursuing violence against Immigrants. These immigrants impact on South Africa has been a topic on SA's agenda for quite sometime dating back to the early 90's. Although the issue inside of SA is not that simple, as many with or without political care still blame immigrants and had started ever since the increase of South Africa’s unemployment and poverty rate before the 1990’s. when the first xenophobic attacks started. After these attacks these issues like immigration and xenophobia started to become deadly and pertinent.

So, what can South Africans do about their growing xenophobia problem? Well according to recent polls many South Africans think that banning immigration to the country would solve the problem, and South Africa has already passed many laws restricting immigration into the country but the number of immigrants into the country is ever growing. So, who are these immigrants and why is South Africa a place they want to go despite the high amount of xenophobia in the country? Well a significant percentage of the immigrants are from Swaziland, a small country encompassed by SA that has an unemployment rate of around 40%. Perhaps the solution to the immigration problem in SA is by helping the countries that people are immigrating from. SA, despite its past with xenophobia is still a tourist country within Africa and is a host for many world events like the Fifa World Cup. Its ability to act as a sojourning location for people outside and within Africa is something that is important for their income and the country will surely try to resolve this issue and prevent it from tarnishing their reputation as a welcoming country.

              An outbreak of xenophobia has left the country of South Africa in a difficult place. With an unemployment rate of around 25%, the people of South Africa have been looking for somebody to take the blame for their poor economic status. Just as in years past many South Africans have been targeting immigrants from other African countries in xenophobic riots that have resulted in the death of five immigrants. Ever since the end of the Apartheid system in 1994 there has been a great amount of immigration into South Africa from countries such as Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Malawi. Many of these immigrants from these countries are fleeing the instability of their homelands and are finding low wage jobs in South Africa. This immigration into South Africa has subsequently brought widespread retaliation that has peaked this year.

Although South Africa has had a fair amount of xenophobic riots in its history, this current outbreak seems to top the rest. A country that was looked at as a place of refuge for those struggling in nearby countries has now become a place of danger. Many have put the blame on Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, who made some controversial remarks on immigrants in South Africa saying that immigrants should "pack their bags and leave". Many families are now being put in worse conditions than the ones they fled, as they are attacked, beaten, and robbed by xenophobic South Africans. The Guardian tell the story of the Chopos, a Zimbabwean family who was starting to settle into their new life in South Africa until one night they were attacked and beaten in their own home. A group of 15 men stole all of their valuables including the life saving HIV medication. They are now forced to live in cramped transit camp where they live with thousands of other immigrants fleeing the danger. Once a country so renowned for its defeat of racial discrimination, now faces its biggest challenge since.
