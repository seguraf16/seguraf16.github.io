                Migrations happen all throughout the world, and it is seen in history continuing to the present day.  One region in particular that has produced many migrants is Central Africa.  Central Africa is a region that is decimated by internal conflicts.  The countries that were paid with particular attention were the Congo, Chad, Rwanda, and Sudan.  Over 550,000 people have been displaced in Central Africa, and about 350,000 Central Africans have fled to neighboring countries due to the humanitarian crises, genocide, and the lack of resources for its citizens.  In the following, there is an interview of an actual migrant from the Congo named Abdul.

              On July 9 2011 South Sudan gained liberation from Sudan and became the world's youngest country.  Internal conflicts have caused 700,000 (I know what you me but specify about the 700,000 and the 150,000) to move from their homes and 150,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Currently there are about 260,000 registered by the UN agency. More info on that number can be found here. Israel is rejecting refugees, not because they are overflowing their refugee camps, but because they unlawfully (why unlawfully? Whose law? Perhaps "unfairly"?) accuse the Sudanese as looking to Israel as an attractive job hunting location. As of November 2014 about 2.6 million congeners (A what? A word that people understand would be best, maybe just "people"? Or "victims"?) have been displaced and this number is not declining.

              has had a history of violence. In 1992, Rwanda was hit with a famine that caused the people to move to neighboring countries. By the end of 1992 there were 85,800 people in Uganda that were native to Rwanda. In 1994, a civil war and genocide broke out and caused 7.5 million Rwandan people to flee their homes. In 2012, the U.N. forced the Rwandans that found asylum in Uganda to return home. Today the Immigration rate of Rwanda 62.8 per 1000 people.

In 2015 The Congo has mostly achieved peace the central government has slowly regained its power. Its relations with its neighboring countries have not gotten any better.
